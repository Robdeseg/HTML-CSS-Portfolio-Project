# Willem Platerink Photography

Willem Platerink is an internationally acclaimed photographer who specialises in African wildlife and culture. With over 20 years experience, he has, over that time, built a global following who are drawn to his unique style when it comes to capturing the beating heart of Africa and its people. His work has featured in print media in over 100 countries as well as exhibiting in some of the most renowed galleries in the world. This website has been designed as an extention of the photographer himself. It is an expression of the artit's style designed to bleed seemlessly through his work and back again. It is a place where collectors, exhibitors and dealers come together to look at work that has sold for several thousand dollars a piece. This is not designed to lasso an impulse purchases, rather it is built to emulate the experience of seeing Mr. Platerink's work in person.

## Tone and Inspiration

    The tone and inspiration for the style and feel of the website came from two sources. The first being the photographer himself. I was lucky to be able to interview him at length and discuss both his work and his philosophies on life. These became important considerations when desiging the essence of the website and how it felt. The second, of course, are the photographs themselves, and these drove the overall look of the site. It was important that his work sat within the pages of the site and looked as though they belonged there and nowhere else.

## Features

    Form follows function. Always. And although that does not mean that compromise is necessary to achieve one before the other, it is important that the overall UX is seamless. The type of visitors to this site are high net worth individuals who expect the world they live in and everything about it to work and work well. This drove the overriding principle of creating a simple and clean aesthetic, that is easy to use and intuitive while giving visitors to the site a visual experience as well.

 I struggled to understand the reason for my title font comiung up in purple. Realised I needed to amend the visited pseudo class.

Footer bleeding off right of page - taking time to fix.

I would have like to have put a globe behind the contact info box, but ran out of time investigating how to superimpose the globe and no background into css. 

The T's & C's, Privacy Policy and Pertnership links are working, but I have not yet created landing pages for them as the photographer is getting the legal documentation in order before committing to the site.

## Credits

W3Schools helped with the arrangement of the photos into two columns in the selected works section.

Coder Coder helped resolve the issue of amending the opacity of the background image (the globe) and not the text on top of it.
