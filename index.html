                <p id="fading-blurb" style="text-align: justify;">“Photography is one of the great paradoxes in the history of mankind. It is, at its core, a single image captured and committed to film. The moment the child smiled, or the lady cried; when the animal yawned or the history of the world changed. Just a lowly, single image – less than a fraction of a fraction of a second. Yet in the unspooling arms of time itself, if it is done well, photography can capture the essence of a whole world, the entirety of a life whose end we still don’t know. And in doing so, that moment, and all the significance it carries, remains imprinted in the sands of time. No matter how softly nor how faintly trodden it might be, a photograph has the ability to capture the soul of the earth and all the beings and the beasts that live within it. It has the ability to change the minds of the many people who walk the strange and meandering path through it. It has the ability to make each one of us realise that we are not walking this path alone. And for that reason, amongst all the many others that go with it hand in hand, it is the most powerful medium I know.”</p>
