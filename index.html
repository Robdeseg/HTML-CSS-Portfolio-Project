            <p class="fading-blurb" style="text-align: justify;">“Photography is one of the great paradoxes in the history of mankind. It is, at its core, nothing more than a single image captured and committed to film. A lowly, single image – less than a fraction of a fraction of one second. Yet, if it is done well, that single image can capture the essence - the very meaning - of what it is to be alive. And in doing so, that moment, and all the significance that it carries, remains with us forever. No matter how softly, nor how faintly trodden it might be, a photograph has the ability to capture the soul of every being and beast that walks this strange and meandering path through the world. It makes us realise we do not walk this path alone.”</p>
